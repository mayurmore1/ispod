Working with Docker Volumes and Networks
• Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generatedby and used by
Dockercontainers.
• By default it stored it within Containers. And when you delete container, the data
isalso lost.
• Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
• You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
• Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
• Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers. Following are
some
command for volume:
docker volume –help
docker volume create &lt;volumename&gt; :
Tocreate volumedocker volume ls : To list volume
docker volume rm &lt;volumename&gt; : to delete
volumedocker volume prune : todelete all unused volumes

We can run a container on a network by assigning specific volume like :-
docker run –name myjenkins1 –v myvol:/var/Jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 –p
50000:50000 Jenkins:2.60.3
You will get a admin password as following
Now goto localhost:8080 and use that password to login and press continue
Now customize your container image by choosing any one option
Now create first admin user
After that finish setup and start using your container
